Hornwall was once the proud capital of the land, a bustling city that was home to the most powerful and influential people in the realm. It was a place of great wealth and prosperity, with magnificent palaces and grand public works that were the envy of neighboring kingdoms.

But all of that changed in an instant when an unknown force swept through the city, laying waste to everything in its path. The people of Hornwall were caught off guard, unable to mount an effective defense against the onslaught. Within days, the city was reduced to rubble, its streets littered with the bodies of the dead and dying.

In the aftermath of the destruction, the few survivors who remained fled the city, leaving it to the dragons that had taken up residence in its ruins. These dragons were unlike any that the people of the land had ever seen before. They were larger and more powerful, with scales that shone like gold in the sun and eyes that glowed with an otherworldly light.

As time passed, the dragons of Hornwall became more and more aggressive, attacking any who dared to approach their domain. They hoarded treasure and valuables in the ruins of the city, jealously guarding their loot against any would-be intruders.

Despite the danger, there were those who were brave enough to venture into the ruins of Hornwall in search of treasure and adventure. Some never returned, their bones left to bleach in the sun alongside the ruins of the city. But others managed to evade the dragons and return to civilization with tales of incredible wealth and unimaginable danger.

Today, Hornwall is a place of legend, a cautionary tale about the dangers of greed and the folly of those who would seek to challenge the power of dragons. The few who dare to venture into its ruins do so at their own peril, knowing that they may never return.
