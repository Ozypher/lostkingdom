FireReach is a safe haven for the reborn, a group of individuals who have been brought back to life after dying in battle. The city was founded by a group of powerful mages who discovered a way to resurrect fallen warriors and give them a second chance at life.

The reborn are a special breed of warriors, imbued with powerful magic and abilities that they did not possess in their previous lives. They are fiercely loyal to their creators and to the city of FireReach, and they serve as its protectors and defenders.

The city of FireReach is a walled fortress, built atop a high plateau surrounded by steep cliffs and treacherous terrain. Its walls are thick and impenetrable, and its gates are guarded by powerful magic that can detect and repel any intruders.

Within the city, the reborn live and train, honing their skills and preparing for battle. They are led by a council of mages who oversee their training and ensure that they remain loyal to the city and its goals.

The reborn of FireReach are not immortal, but they have been given a second chance at life. They are driven by a sense of duty and honor, and they are willing to risk everything to protect the city and its people.

Today, FireReach stands as a beacon of hope and a symbol of strength in a world torn apart by war and chaos. The reborn who call it home are respected and feared by all who know of them, and they serve as a reminder of the power of magic and the resilience of the human spirit.
