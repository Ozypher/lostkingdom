When a fight begins, the aggresor goes first.

During an enemy turn, they will perform an attack and you may choose to either:
**Block**: drain 4 stamina, and take a quarter of the damage.
**Dodge**: drain 8 stamina, and if succesful take no damage, otherwise take half.
**Parry:** You can attempt to parry attacks within reason, rolling a d20 to match the enemy roll +- your chosen weapon's stat.  Parrying an attack will allow you to cancel their attack and give you two actions during your turn, as well as lowering their stability by 2.

During your turn, you may do anything that you would want to and standard tabletop rules apply.

There are no saving throws, if you die you will return to the last place you "convened".

Enemies in crowds will all attack you at once.
