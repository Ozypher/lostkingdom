The Turned are a type of ghoul-like creature that emerged after the curse fell upon the land. They were once human, but have been transformed by the curse into twisted and deformed beings with an insatiable hunger for flesh.

The Turned are driven by an intense urge to consume the flesh of the living, and will attack anyone who crosses their path. They are relentless and cunning hunters, using their keen senses and agility to track down their prey.

The origins of the Turned are not well understood, but it is believed that they were created by the dark magic of the curse. Some speculate that they are the result of an attempt by the curse to create an army of undead soldiers, while others believe that they are simply the unintended consequence of the curse's dark powers.

Regardless of their origins, the Turned are a constant threat to the people of the land, lurking in the shadows and waiting to pounce on their unsuspecting victims. They are particularly dangerous in areas that have been abandoned or left unguarded, where they can multiply and establish their own nests.

Many people live in constant fear of the Turned, knowing that they could be attacked at any moment. Some have even taken to fortifying their homes and communities, hoping to ward off the threat of the Turned and other dangers that lurk in the dark corners of the land.

Despite their fearsome reputation, there are those who seek to study the Turned, hoping to uncover the secrets of their transformation and find a way to reverse it. But such endeavors are fraught with danger, as the Turned are fiercely protective of their kind and will stop at nothing to defend themselves and their nests.
