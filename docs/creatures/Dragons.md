In the world where Hornwall once stood, dragons are powerful and fearsome creatures that are both respected and feared by the people who inhabit the land. These creatures are born with powerful magic coursing through their veins, which allows them to breathe fire, control the elements, and even shape-shift into human form.

In the past, dragons were worshipped as gods by some cultures, who believed that they were the protectors of the land and the guardians of its secrets. Others saw them as terrifying beasts, to be avoided at all costs.

Over time, dragons became rarer and rarer, until they were thought to be extinct. But with the fall of Hornwall and the rise of the curse, they began to reappear, drawn to the chaos and destruction that the curse brought with it.

Today, dragons are a constant presence in the land, inhabiting remote mountain ranges, ancient ruins, and other inaccessible places. They are highly intelligent and possess a great deal of knowledge, but they are also fiercely territorial and will not hesitate to defend their lairs with deadly force.

Despite their fearsome reputation, some brave adventurers seek out dragons in the hopes of gaining their favor or acquiring their hoards of treasure. But such endeavors are fraught with danger, and only the most skilled and cunning individuals can hope to survive an encounter with a dragon.
